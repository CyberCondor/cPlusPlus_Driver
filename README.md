<sub><sup>Custom String and List libraries to showcase dynamic memory allocation using circular linked lists.</sup></sub><br>

This code demonstrates dynamic memory allocation in C++ using circular linked lists.
I wrote some of this code back in Computer Science 2 class and have since revisited it to better understand C++ and computer memory usage of programs during runtime.

This code is a work in progress. It will eventually be used to display data in graphical format.
